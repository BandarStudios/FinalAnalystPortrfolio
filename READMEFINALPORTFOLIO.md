  **1.Portfolio Introduction**
  -This Portfolio is a showcase of my best work throughout the course Data Analysis - 2024S (SIS-750-007). This portfolio represents a collection of my best projects and analyses, demonstrating the skills and techniques acquired during this course.Here, you will find detailed presentations, insightful posters, exemplary code chunks, and a comprehensive analyst resume, all reflecting my proficiency in data analysis and visualization.
  
  **Presentation Introduction**
  -For this assignment, I created a 4 slide presentation where I investigated urban social disorder, specifically comparing outcomes with and without fatalities (Death vs. No Death), to understand the dynamics within rapidly expanding urban regions. My focus was on the increasing global urbanization and the associated challenges related to social disorder. The aim was to explore mortality trends in urban environments using a comprehensive dataset. I delved deeply into this dataset, employing selection criteria that targeted capital cities worldwide and those with population growth exceeding 1000% between 1960 and 2014.
  -I highlighted the significant milestone where more people currently reside in cities than rural areas for the first time in history, a trend projected to exceed 70% by 2050. Consequently, concerns have been raised regarding premature industrialization, poverty, inequality, and overpopulation in certain regions. Additionally, the dataset provided insights into urban violence on a global scale.
  -I created multiple slides with marplot graphs to show the visualization aspect. The primary objective was to visualize and analyze trends using data visualization techniques. I employed R programming with libraries such as ggplot2, dplyr, and readxl for data manipulation and visualization.
Key findings and insights from the dataset highlighted the milestone where urban populations surpassed rural populations for the first time in history. This trend is projected to exceed 70% by 2050, raising concerns about premature industrialization, poverty, inequality, and overpopulation in urban areas.The presentation consisted of four slides incorporating ggplot2 visualizations to illustrate average events per decade, average number of deaths, and average number of non-death events over time. Each visualization aimed to convey trends and patterns related to urban social disorder dynamics.

  **Poster Introduction**
-My research poster titled "Polyarchy Within The GCC Compared to North Africa" explored the differences in polyarchy levels between Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and North African nations using data from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project. The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether there is a discernible contrast in democratic practices between these regions. The analysis focuses on indicators of electoral democracy, civil liberties, and political participation extracted from the V-Dem Country-Year Core dataset, specifically targeting GCC countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE) and North African countries (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia). 

-The methodology and approach nvolved data filtering and extraction to isolate observations from these specific geopolitical contexts. Statistical techniques such as linear regression and descriptive analyses are employed to assess regional trends in polyarchy levels. Visualizations including box plots, scatter plots with regression lines, and comparative analyses are used to illustrate and interpret the findings. The libraries ggplot2, dplyr, and modelsummary etc were used or data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. 

  **Exemplary CodeChunk**
 -This code snippet fixes errors in the original script and then calculates summary statistics for average urban greenspace (annual_avg_2020) by major geographical regions (Major_Geo_Region) using the dplyr package for data manipulation and knitr for generating a nicely formatted table.This code demonstrates effective use of data manipulation and summarization techniques with dplyr, proper handling of missing data, and generation of neat output using kable for presentation-ready tables in R.

  **Analyst Resume**
-This document serves as a summary and resume of my relevant qualifications and experiences in the field of data analysis and international affairs.
